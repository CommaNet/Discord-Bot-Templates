# Discord Bot Templates

## Description:

You can push any Discord bot formats here, may these be commands, events, snippets, functions or handlers. Be sure to insert a license with your code/folder to prevent people from claiming to have coded it themselves! Also please make sure to insert your code inside of a folder. This is to make sure the GitHub stays organized. Example:
`./LionLuke-CatchFunction/stuff-here`

## Notes:

+ Please do not forget to insert a license or some form of proof that you created the code, we are not to be held responsible for any stolen code from this GitHub
+ Please remove any kind of authorization token from your code before submitting it here
+ Thank you for considering to submit your code to our GitHub!
