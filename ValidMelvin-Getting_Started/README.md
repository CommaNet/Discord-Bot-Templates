 # Getting started with Discord.js
 ## Setup
• To simply get started with the usage of JavaScript with the Discord.js library, you are required to have at least some JavaScript knowledge.
• So lets just get started, but before we get started here are some little things you will have to do:
- Create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on the bot section on your application. You will see the section called "token". That will be your password for your client.
- We will now have to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), I highly recommend the usage of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [vscode-insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
- Now that you have vscode (insiders) installed, go ahead and install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) if you haven't alread
- Go ahead and make a folder on your desktop (or anywhere, you should just be able to find it later). Right click that folder and hit [open with Visual Studio Code (Insiders)](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Great, if you've followed along until here without any trouble.

## Getting started with npm
- What is npm? Simple, npm is a JavaScript packet manager many developers use for installing packages such as Discord.js, which we will be using.
- You will not have to install npm as it will be installed with [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) 
- Open a command prompt, change the directory to the folder on your desktop or wherever you have it saved. 
- Now install Discord.js with the npm command: npm i discord.js 
- You can also use the visual studio code (insiders) terminal to run that command.
