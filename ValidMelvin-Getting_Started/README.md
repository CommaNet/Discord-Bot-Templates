## Getting started with Discord.js
# Setup
• To simply get started with the usage of JavaScript with the Discord.js library, you are required to have at least some JavaScript knowledge.
• So lets just get started, but before we get started here are some little things you will have to do:
- Create an application on the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on the bot section on your application. You will see the section called "token". That will be your password for your client.
- We will now have to get an IDE (Integrated Development Environment), I highly recommend the usage of [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [vscode-insiders](https://code.visualstudio.com/insiders/).
